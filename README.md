# PerfectInternRepo
The idea for this website was to help students find internships and help companies find vetted candidates. 

In order to send emails I am using an open source lambda developed by [@yabsi](https://github.com/yabsi). I did alter it a tad and have a cloudformation for it somewhere, but it worked pretty well out of the box.
